Trump Executive Orders Sentiment Analysis (2025)

üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes public sentiment regarding Trumps election win and key executive orders issued by Trump in 2025 by scraping and processing Reddit posts. The analysis focuses on:
- Executive Order Impact: Comparing public sentiment 3 days before and after key executive orders, such as the Federal Hiring Freeze, Remote Work Ban, and Doge Department Lunch.
- Keyword Trends: Tracking the prevalence of phrases (e.g., "doge department", "Elon Musk") in post titles.
- Engagement Metrics: Examining the relationship between sentiment and engagement (computed as post upvote ratio multiplied by the number of comments).
- Temporal Analysis: Aggregating sentiment on a daily basis to observe trends over time.

The ultimate goal is to create compelling visualizations that reveal how public sentiment shifts in response to political events.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

Data Collection
- Scraping:  
  Reddit posts were scraped using the [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/) library from subreddits like `politics`, `conservative`, and `news`.  
  - Parameters:  
    - Keywords: "trump", "executive order", "federal"  
    - Date Range: From `2025-01-20` onward  
  - The raw scraped data was saved as CSV files.

Data Cleaning
- Techniques:  
  The raw data underwent extensive cleaning:
  - Removal of URLs and special characters  
  - Expansion of contractions (using the `contractions` package)  
  - Conversion to lowercase and removal of stopwords (using NLTK)  
  - Lemmatization (using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer)  
- Outcome:  
  Cleaned data was saved in files such as `election_posts_clean.csv` and `executive_posts_clean.csv`.

Sentiment Analysis
- Tool:  
  NLTK‚Äôs VADER sentiment analyzer was used to compute sentiment scores (compound, positive, negative, neutral) for textual fields.
- Overall Sentiment:  
  The overall sentiment score for each post is computed as the average of compound scores from the post title and comment body.
- Temporal Aggregation:  
  Daily average sentiment scores were calculated to assess trends over time.

Advanced Analyses
1. Executive Order Impact:  
   Posts within a 3-day window before and after each executive order were compared. The analysis calculates:
   - Average sentiment before (pre_sentiment) and after (post_sentiment) each order  
    
2. Keyword Trends:
   Boolean indicators track the presence of specific keywords (e.g., "doge department", "Elon Musk") in post titles. These indicators are then analyzed across sentiment bins to reveal trends.

3. Engagement Metrics:  
   Engagement is defined as the product of the post‚Äôs upvote ratio and its number of comments. The analysis explores the correlation between overall sentiment and engagement.

Visualizations
Visualizations were created in Python using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Key charts include:
- Executive Order Impact Chart:  
  - A bar chart comparing pre- and post-executive order sentiment.
  - Saved as `executive_impact.png`.
  
- Keyword Trends Visualization: 
  - A bar chart showing the average frequency of key phrases in post titles.
  - A heatmap illustrating keyword frequency across different sentiment bins.
  - Saved as `keyword_heatmap.png`.

- Engagement Metrics Analysis:  
  - A scatter plot that examines the relationship between overall sentiment and engagement, with a trend line indicating the correlation.
  - Saved as `engagement_analysis.png`.

- Daily Sentiment Time Series:  
  - A line chart plotting the daily average overall sentiment with markers for executive orders.
  - Saved as `daily_sentiment.png`.
 
- Distrubution of overall sentiment
  - Displays the distribution of overall sentiment for the election win.
  - Saved as 'election_sentiment_histogram'
 
- Daily average sentiment
  - Tracks daily sentiment trends to show how public opinion evolves over time.
  - Saved as 'election_sentiment_timeseries'
