Most people thought they’d collapse in a few days. Putin thought so too. He’s had varying degrees of success in his military decision making but his people kicked Russia out of a lot of the country before reaching the theater today, and everyone thought that would be impossible too. 

As for allegations of corruption, there’s been no widespread embezzlement alleged by our inspector generals and most of what they got was old gear we were going to get rid of and we’d see obvious black market activity if that was going on as they are all serial numbered. Much of the appropriation has made new stuff here to allow the release of old stuff to Ukraine ahead of when we’d otherwise dispose of it. Zelensky commented that he didn’t know where a lot of the money is because Ukraine hasn’t received 175b from us, they’ve received a bit more than 100b. Much of the money went to internal upgrades to our stuff. 

The job of a president ultimately is to pick the people doing things to get positive outcomes for their country. Other than the interaction  with Trump and Vance the other day he’s done a much better job than anyone thought.",1740954329.0,2025-03-02 23:25:29,Conservative

The other benefits is that with Russia's oil and gas industries being sanctioned and destroyed, the USA can play a larger role in energy security for Europe. 

Next, because the USA signed the Budapest Memorandum, which said it would help Ukraine if it's sovereignty was threatened. An agreement signed for Ukraine to give up its nuclear weapons. Honouring commitments like these help the USA stand out as a strong ally and signal to other adversaries (China / Iran) and threatened partners (Taiwan / Israel) that the USA doesn't back down from support. 

Lastly, because appeasement does not work. Neville Chamberlain, at the time, got the deal of the century for the poor Czechoslovaks, from a belligerent Nazi Germany. Only for Germany to tear up the agreement, stronger than ever, and plunge Europe into total catastrophic war.

I don’t really have facts about how he came to power just from what I’ve seen these last years about him in interviews. I truly believe he wants to stop this war but on his terms a few things I think.

1. He wants Russia to completely move out of former Ukraine areas. That’s just not going to happen Ukraine straight up doesn’t have the manpower to even think about enforcing something like that which is exactly why he’s has been asking for security benefits.


2. I think he has a little bit of a messiah complex. I think that he thinks that he HAS to be the one in charge because he’s either afraid of the next leader bending over to Russia or the next leader completely botching the military side 

3. He thinks Russia won’t stop. The comment he said to trump about it will affect us wasn’t a threat it was a warning. “if you let Russia do this what’s stopping them from being emboldened to attack Poland” kinda thing I personally don’t think that’s the case maybe that’s naivety on my part but Russia has already burned through a lot just to get where they are in Ukraine I don’t see them doing much else.

We have spent over 100 billion on this conflict with essentially no benefit.


Russia gdp went up 3% last year.  They lost a lot of troops but mostly criminals, mercenaries, immigrants and koreans.  Putin is more popular than he has been in a  long time.  Their population is happier with lower unemployment. Their military industry is being rebuilt. They have gotten much cozier with the Chinese. 


And most importantly their neighbors are terrified of them. 


It is a massive negative for us. 


Compare it with Israel.  About 3 billion per year and they win their wars.  All of them. Hamas is crushed for the foreseeable future. They are a lightening rod for terrorist attacks with very good success, with two notable exceptions.  They give us massive intellegence assests in the region.  And they not only test out our technology, they improve on it and share the results with us.

Frankly, I suspect Zelensky doesn't really want the war to end, not when he's lining his pockets.

I feel for the Ukrainians, I really do, but we can't be expected to foot 99% of the bill for a country who's leader acts like a petulant kid and demands more, especially when we've been ignoring our own people.

We can’t send more than $770 to California wildfire victims, yet we've sent over 300 billion dollars to Ukraine.

 Ukrainian elites and politicians were a shit show before they became living saints through the magic of propaganda. 

Ukraine is known to be the most corrupt country in Europe and not even far to the worst in the world. 

It got to the point where a former boxing champion was elected mayor of the capital and a former comedian/TV host became president. 

Zelensky, before he was president of Ukraine, was a comedian who played an unknown person elected president against corruption by a popular movement. 

Zelensky was the guy who hosted the Magic New Year's Eve show on Russian Channel 2 in 2013.

1. Ukraine is not an ally. - They won't do anything if Russia were to attack us. An ally is someone you can depend on to help you militarily. 

2. Ukraine's hate and recklessness are a liability to both themselves and, literally, all of humanity. - Before the actual escalation of hostilities, Ukrainian state television was telling people how to make Molotov cocktails. ""I Live, I Fight, I Win : Rules of Life In War"", made by the Russian equivalent to the VFW and given to soldiers by their MoD, specifically tells soldiers to avoid turning on their cell phones, as the Ukranian operators will not only send your position to a local artillery team, but will then find out who you are and harass your family. Ukrainian forces used naval drones equipped with Starlink transceivers that were donated by Musk for civilian purposes. The use of civilian infrastructure, which is normally protected under international humanitarian law, for military purposes seems to be omnipresent. The use of Starlink is especially troublesome as it exposes satellites to attack. Anti-satellite weapons pollute space.

3. Neo-Nazis are everywhere. - The Azov Brigade was specifically sanctioned (by Democrats) for being neo-Nazis from 2018 to 2024 and Democrats wanted them on the Foreign Terrorist Organization list in 2019. The local SS division is publicly honored, especially in Lviv, and the founder of that group later became the chief editor the Encyclopedia of Ukraine.

Reddit isn’t a sample either way.

My conservatism is pragmatic and guided on a couple first principles. My moral values are Protestant Christian and I heavily rely upon empiricism which also led to a lot of what’s in the constitution. 


Things I generally believe 

1) power close to the problem or need at stake. So less federalism usually and just less state in general. Without the context the decisions are often awful. Of possible power should be at the individual or family level. 

2) there are certain common anti patterns that do need rules. Tragedy of the commons, debt slavery, the tendency of nations towards mercantilism, a lack of order hurting everyone, etc. 

3) the state should be operational and not pushing values and religion 

I also think management science is one of our greatest learnings and institution and think LLC and effective mission focused management is really important to things being effective. I am very excited that Trump is pushing federal orgs to their basic purpose and away from distractions. The left warped them away from their mission and into idealogical symbolism. 

I am not pro Iraq/Afghanistan occupation but think Ukraine is a lot more economical in terms of our long term interests.

But as a ""true patriot"" of America, I don't see why my kids should be sent to die for Ukraine. The US IG in charge of Ukrainian funding reports that from Jan'22 to Dec'24, the US has promised over $180B in aid and another $20B in loans, with about a third of that already delivered. As a ""true patriot"" of America, I'd rather that $200B be spent on US citizens.

Everyone dismisses him as a comedian but he built and successfully ran his own media fiefdom which was successful in Russia and Ukraine. He's got a law degree and knows the power of the camera. That's how he's built such a strong brand in the West. 

I also genuinely hate how liberals fawn over him so bad. Like I get it, but they have no idea of patriotism and loyalty, and sacrifice that he's made for Ukraine.

If so, big disagree thar. You can easily learn a language, and even become conversational with free resources, and apps. There's even sites you can use to schedule one-on-one chats with native-speaking tutors who can guide you and correct you.

Granted most ""apps"" are terrible from my experience (looking at you Duolingo), but a really good one will cost like $10/mo. And glancing at a tutor site right now, and most tutors charge $18-$22 for a 1-hour session - and some of the super high-end, professional ones cost around $30+ per hour.

Let's assume it'll take a year to get to where you want in a language. That'd cost:

* $10 for 12 months = $120
* 15 tutoring lessons (for 15 hours) for $20 each

For that year, you'd pay $420 >!(~~smoke weed~~ learn language every day).!<

That's not really that much in the grand scheme of things. Plus the 1-on-1 tutoring is optional, and many people forgo it because they have friends or can do language exchanges for free.

Actual estimates are 2 trillion over 10 years, plus the bill also had around 2 trillion in cuts. Tax cuts are huge for the middle and lower class, and will do a ton in improving buying power as it doesnt increase costs on the companies at all. 

Were only just in the second month, theres a lot of time to make more cuts and increase tax revenue from elsewhere.  We have to raise the debt ceiling as we operate with a deficit and its not something that will be solved in a year, especially with plans to shift how we obtain tax revenue. Its easier to make the tax cuts first, as then we will have an idea of how much revenue we will be bringing in.

Kash Patel as director of the ATF determines how the agency defines terms and acts on legislation and court rulings.

Additionally he has the authority to create amnesty periods for the sale of fully automatic firearms, hold enough of these and it would be simple to argue that fully automatic firearms are ""in common use"".

... See, you aren't off to a good start when your first two sentences contradict. Where you are wrong is the ""completely independently"" part. They do not have any independence that the President does not grant. And the rest of your framing falls apart when you realize that.

And if the president decides to take an advisor, and orders a department/agency needs to listen to them, that is effectively not any different than doing a run around the confirmation process. And what Trump is doing is ordering every department to let him in and make spending and personnel decisions. 

>If you genuinely believe elon holds any real power in the federal government you are an imbecile.

I just watched him email and order every single federal employee to do something. I've only ever seen that from the President, but that was through the proper chain of commands (not directly).

P.S.: He blocked me, so I can't respond. He even called me ""stupid""! Maybe I am, but at least I'm not a coward.

Two things to consider that I think need more attention:

- every person that doesn't pay, their costs get spread out to everyone else.   this is exacerbated by US law that requires all people to be seen and made stable in US emergency rooms.   People without insurance know they can go to the ER for treatment - and they do so for non emergency illness.   We are *all* paying for that.  It's also a major contributor to overcrowding and wait times in ER rooms.

- medical malpractice insurance and lawsuits are a **major** cost for medical providers.

Most high quality prescription glasses are less than $30 from online retailers like Zenni, and less than $150 at independent retail stores like Costco.

If you stay away from retail stores that double as Optometrist offices (e.g., LensCrafters, VisionWorks), the price of glasses is usually less than the copay on a “vision insurance” plan. And it’s certainly less than the copay + premiums.

\> We should be using medication to treat illnesses, not as compensation for an unhealthy lifestyle.

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, it's not the result of an unhealthy lifestyle. Even for type 2 genetics, age, and socioeconomic conditions play a major role.

\> Diabetics used to eat a strict diet to prevent high blood sugar prior to the invention of insulin. 

Yes, they would, and then they would die. It was a death sentence -- 50% died within 2 years of diagnosis, and 90% within 5 years. The mortality rate alone proves that diet management is not an effective standalone strategy for managing type 1 diabetes.

\> This diet is basically torture and I wouldn't wish it on anyone, ...

Agreed. Also, a starvation diet is not an option for children -- it stunts physical and cognitive development. 

\> ...but it is possible.

Physically possible? Sure. Medically effective? Absolutely not. Your own sources configm that this diet doesn't eliminate the need for insulin; it prolongs suffering before death. That's not a viable treatment strategy and you're reaching quite a bit here by suggesting it's a possible treatment.  
  
\> Would you like to acknowledge that a diabetic person with a healthy diet requires less insulin than one with an unhealthy diet?

Absolutely! Diet, activity, and exercise all impact blood sugar and can help flatten spikes and troughs in blood sugar levels and reduce insulin dependence. However, it doesn't eliminate the need for insulin or the need to have it on-hand in sufficient quantities when someone decides to change up their physical routine, engage in hobbies, or compete in sport. Encouraging a healthy diet and lifestyle is not a substitute for making life-saving medication affordable. Pricing is still a critical issue. I'd also argue that the prevalence of low quality, highly processed foods in this country (loaded with synthetic additives, glucose, and fructose) makes healthy eating even more challenging, particularly for average families.

\> Not only would they be buying less insulin, but a lower demand means a lower cost.

You're assuming the insulin market follows simple supply and demand but we know that pharma companies already artificially inflate and manipulate prices. Even with decreased demand there's no guarantee it would lead to lower prices. Decreased volume could even drive up per unit production prices.

We're talking about life saving medication that's been around for more than a hundred years for an autoimmune disease, not some luxury drug like ozempic that enables people to live without consequence. I also don't really care how it's accomplished, if it's not price cap through EO or regulation then big pharma should be incentivized to limit hostage profiteering on these types of life saving medications by there own choice.",1740598062.0,2025-02-26 20:27:42,Conservative

Before joining the bench, he was a frequent donor to Maryland Democrats, notably Maryland Comptroller Brooke Lierman, with whom he clerked and who has championed progressive economic policies aligned with globalization, such as equitable trade and resource distribution. His nomination to the federal judiciary by President Joe Biden in May 2024—supported by Senators Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats with records of endorsing international cooperation and liberal economic policies—suggests backing from a political network favoring globalization. Confirmed by the Senate on September 10, 2024, by a 53-43 vote, Abelson’s ascent reflects the influence of campaign contributors and leaders who prioritize a globally integrated legal and economic framework.

Prior to his current role, Abelson served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge for the District of Maryland from September 2023 to September 2024, handling preliminary criminal proceedings and civil disputes. His judicial tenure has already made an impact; in February 2025, he ruled against a Trump administration policy targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, arguing it violated First Amendment rights—a decision critics might view as favoring progressive, globalist-backed principles over nationalist policies.",1740191998.0,2025-02-22 03:39:58,Conservative

My ideal compromise would be a specific fertility insurance policy add-on, so that it's cheaper for anyone who actually needs treatments, but the entire population doesn't have to pay higher premiums for something that is an individual choice.  

I understand the argument for declining birth rates, but to me it still feels like cherry picking an issue we ""like"" to pay for.  To get all slippery slope here, there's lots of things that can incentivize higher birth rates.  Government-paid parental leave, government-subsidized daycare, higher taxes for universal pre-K, etc.  Or an Executive Order to force employers to provide parental leave, which again is a very anti-conservative stance.  

I'd also be curious at the correlation or even causation of our piss-poor health and fertility.  As a woman, I've been told there's risk factors for female fertility problems, such as obesity, PCOS, other hormone issues, stress, possibly even poor diet and food quality.

With the more natural fertility treatment attempts and the IVF, everything cost 43k and 4 years of work and effort, paired with many emotional conflicts.

As someone who has spent a lot of time with fertility doctors, the general consensus is it is unknown what is the core cause of most infertility in women. Men is more well known, lots of things affect testosterone including microplastics lifestyle choices. But women increasingly suffering infertility imo is a genetic trait, similar to how eyesight is getting worse each generation, infertility gets worse as we break the laws of evolution by developing tools that help us pass on less genetically advantageous genes. That's part of what makes us human though, we evolved brains and used them to break the tyranny of natural selection. IVF is one of those tools, and since our country does not support a sustaining birth rate of 2.2 children born per women on average, we will suffer greatly in future generations without some crazy advancement in automation.

Also, stop with the no true Scottsman fallacy, you don't get to define purely what is conservative and isn't. It's your opinion that it isn't very conservative, but many disagree. I disagree for example because I believe that part of conservatism is thoughtful and efficient spending of government funds, such as defense spending, or civilian infustructre. To me, infertility treatment is a form of generational and cultural defense of American citizens helping us to rely less on immigration to stave off our declining birth rate.

Biology can just get messy sometimes, and tragedies like ectopic pregnancies can happen. Difficulties in conceiving can happen; my brother and I were not exactly miracle babies but our mom had a hell of a time conceiving us because of serious internal biological issues. Had IVF been an affordable option back in the day she might have done that and saved herself a lot of heartache. 

Please look at and consider the heart of those who consider and follow through with IVF. They are trying desperately to bring life into this world. Yes, many embryos are fertilized and many will not make it, but they're all sent in with the hope that even one will (and hey, sometimes many will!).

Because things like ectopic pregnancies and miscarriages can happen, which is a natural though sad occurrence of a fertilized egg not coming to term, I don't see IVF and the potential loss of fertilized eggs as such a vile means to the end of bringing life into the world.

* \#1: He's being hyperbolic. However, he kind of double downs on it and says stuff like, ""Actually, I'll have it solved before I even take office"" or ""I'll have it done on the first day.""
* \#2: ""He lies, but the other side lies too, and at least we know when he lies.""
* \#3: ""I don't care that he lies. If lying is what it takes to bring down the establishment elitists, so be it.""
* \#4: ""I believe that he believes it."" In other words, he genuinely believed he could do it in 24 hours. We knew it wasn't true, but if he believed that, then he is not lying, and it shows how serious he is about trying something different. This could also apply to other things like 2020 election.

Where the parks are and have been built: not always done regardless of race (and more importantly wealth).

So, the general idea is that underserved communities don't have easy access to as many parks as wealthier communities that can easily travel to these destinations. Also, superfund sites are predominantly in poorer communities, so if the park's service can build monuments with amenities closer to the poorer communities that's good. And if they can help clean up contaminated sites in the process even better.

Personally, I'd like this stuff worded better and to see more evidence of its successes. More importantly, I want way more funding for our parks and our rangers. Maybe in the end all of this chaos from the Whitehouse and Doge will teach everyone to be more deliberate with the words they use and shine some light on areas where we need *more* spending and not *less*. Even if the entire federal workforce were laid off, we'd only save \~271 billion dollars a year and we'd have 1.5 trillion more to save to balance the budget. The government is already operating pretty lean, so if we had software that caught waste and misallocation of funds (like social security checks going out when they shouldn't) we could save a lot more than cutting random employees. If we let tax cuts expire and raised revenues then we could save more. Government waste, while real and needs addressing by Inspectors Generals when found, is less the problem, whereas dated (or lack thereof) of software and the budget itself are the main culprits to the debt and deficit we have.a",1739888973.0,2025-02-18 15:29:33,Conservative

My son is a park ranger with the NPS whose summer position is in a hiring freeze and that chart doesn't help your argument.

Let's bring some of the chart info forward shall we?

* $1,034,000 for 7 FTE (that's short for full time employees) at the ""Emmett Till and Mamie Till Mobley NHS"".  That's $147,714 per person at a two location monument (MS and IL) whose building the NPS doesn't even own or maintain.  That's likely a couple of interpretive rangers and managers and site director...and I can guarantee you the 3-4 rangers aren't making near on $150K/year.
* $1,010,000 for 6 FTE at the ""Brown v. Board of Education National Historical Park - Summerton Site Expansion"" (that last part is important).  That's $168,333 per person for the ""Summerton Site"".  Know what that is?  It's a plaque on Summerton High School....except it's no longer a school and the park service doesn't own this either.  In fact, the historic building is used today as the administrative building for Clarendon County School District #1.  What do you suppose those 6 FT position employees do as part of the ""Summerton Site Expansion"" considering the ""Summerton Site"" is a bronze plaque on the wall of a private building?

I won't belabor the rest but they're all ridiculous wastes of taxpayer money because $1,000,000 for 5 FTE positions to ""\[s\]upport management of subsistence uses of NPS lands in Alaska"" is later defined thusly:

>This funding supports the management of subsistence hunting, trapping, and fishing on NPS lands and waters in Alaska. Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) establishes that subsistence uses of fish and wildlife shall be given priority over other uses of these resources for rural Alaska residents (Native and non-Native). This “rural preference” allows local rural residents to engage in subsistence hunting, fishing, and trapping on Federal public lands.

These five positions are brand new.  None existed before the 2025 NPS budget.  This funding (keep in mind, we're talking 5 positions at an average of $200,000/yr) is justified as ""NPS **recognize the significance** of traditional Alaska Native and non-Native subsistence uses as a cultural value of the people"" and ""also **recognizes the importance** of maintaining unimpaired ecosystems and natural and healthy populations of fish and wildlife"" and that ""Dedicated program staff will **ensure the consistent resourcing and focus** the program deserves"" except this is about Alaska natives being allowed ""to engage in subsistence hunting, fishing, and trapping on Federal public lands"".  That's it.  These 5 positions, which never existed before and for which there is clearly no need...well, they're there now.  Know how to apply for one of those?  Nope and it's okay because, guaranteed, they're already filled by people who may or may not show up for the job...but they'll get paid for it.  Because, you know, ""recognizing"" and ""focusing"" is something you can do remotely...or hell, not at all.

This is merely one example of the massive amounts of grift that DOGE is going after...and rightly so.

Let's assume this was indeed earmarked for ""running advertisements in communities that don't traditionally go to the national parks"".  Think about that for a moment.  The ""in communities"" targeting part cuts out television, radio and most internet advertising.  That leaves local newspapers and billboards as those can be fairly targeted to communities.  Let's imagine for a moment that you own a billboard company that has billboards in predominantly black urban areas.  You'd be the ideal candidate to run these ads and get some of that sweet earmarked money, right?  Well, here's where the grift happens and we have only so far to look as the recent debacles for the government providing rural internet access and building electric recharge stations.

Unless you were the advertising business owner who suggested this cutout, your company won't be the one receiving those federal dollars.  Your competitor who did suggest it, will gladly ""donate"" half that ad budget money back to his local Democrat senate or House rep...he'll get the contract.  Even if your billboards are cheaper and more numerous, he'll be the ""minority or female owned business"" and the Fed has contracting preferences for them so there's how you lose out on the bid...even if your bid is superior.

All for something that isn't the focus of operating a national park.  This is the same mindset when the left bleats about voter disenfranchisement when voter ID is mandated.

initial costs required to establish this new park unit, including a superintendent and a site manager

and provide educational support to visitors of the new park, and a maintenance worker to support
facility needs. Funding will also cover start-up and support costs for the new site’s first full year

Here: ""will support initial costs required to establish this new park unit""

and ""Funding will also cover start-up and support costs for the new site’s first full year of operations, including administrative support.""

A 100k salary does NOT cost the employer 100k. Figure in the matching SSI contribution (7.5%), plus however much the health insurance contribution is (10k? who knows, not cheap though), software licensing, office space, potential costs related to HR and compliance, and more.

However, one of us took an extra moment to see ""just what is the Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument""...and it clearly wasn't you.  Let ME help YOU.

First, this isn't a new monument.  It's been there for two years...this will be it's 3rd year operating.  It's operated for 2 years without the need for ""leadership"", ""supervision of park operations"" and ""interpretive rangers to engage with and provide educational support to visitors"" and a ""maintenance worker to support facility needs"".  Know why?  Because the two buildings that make up this monument aren't NPS properties.  One is the county courthouse in Sumner, MS and the other is the Roberts Temple Church of God in Christ in Chicago.  Both still functioning as a courthouse and a church, respectively.  In other words, private property.

To quote/paraphrase a recent post: ""Now do YOU see it? Or should I make it clear enough for even someone like you?""

You know what the NPS does offer at the Mississippi site (that would be the courthouse)?  They offer a ""self-guided tour app"".  So, no interp rangers needed.  Indeed, there's no facility for them to be located in...so I guess that obviates the need for that maintenance worker...much less ""leadership"" or ""supervision of park operations"".  

For the Illinois location, the park service itself on their site asks ""Public access is limited to the exterior of the building. Please respect the private property of the church. Visitor information is located at Pullman National Historical Park 11 miles to the south.""  Again, no office or visitor facility so no rangers, no maintenance and no ""leadership"" or ""supervision"" needed.

The rest of your screed is fairly useless shite in light of the facts above.  Like you, I DID read the budget document.  Unlike you, I went just a layer deeper.  Contrary to the budget sheet, there ARE NO ""initial costs required to establish this new park unit"" because the park unit has been in existence for going on three years now.  The NPS' own page about the park was last updated in October of 2023.

So, someone who doesn't have a particular axe to grind but is inquisitive enough to regard with healthy skepticism might ask ""why does the 2025 budget document address an existing facility as new so as to justify allocating over $1,000,000 for positions it clearly doesn't need""?",1739914476.0,2025-02-18 22:34:36,Conservative

Think about what the job description for this position would actually read like.  Not some nebulous concept on a line item in a budget document but the actual job description itself because here's the entirety of the budget definition for this ""job"":

>**Alaska Subsistence Management** (+$1,000,000 / +5 FTE) – The Administration is committed to respecting and strengthening Indigenous connections, enhancing our Nation-to-Nation relationships, and fully upholding our trust and treaty responsibilities. ***This funding supports the management of subsistence hunting, trapping, and fishing on NPS lands and waters in Alaska***. Title VIII of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) establishes that subsistence uses of fish and wildlife shall be given priority over other uses of these resources for rural Alaska residents (Native and non-Native). This “rural preference” allows local rural residents to engage in subsistence hunting, fishing, and trapping on Federal public lands. Nowhere else in the United States is there a Federally mandated program to manage traditional subsistence harvests of fish and wildlife on Federal lands, including national parks, monuments, and preserves. ANILCA mandates that NPS recognize the significance of traditional Alaska Native and non-Native subsistence uses as a cultural value of the people in and around most national park lands in Alaska that preserves a vital piece of America’s heritage. It also recognizes the importance of maintaining unimpaired ecosystems and natural and healthy populations of fish and wildlife as a foundation for providing opportunities for traditional subsistence activities and other uses for future generations. The NPS has facilitated the program in the past through funded projects, such as harvest studies conducted cooperatively with local Tribes and other rural communities, and research on fish and wildlife populations. Dedicated program staff will ensure the consistent resourcing and focus the program deserves.

The italicized and bolded parts are the only thing that comes close to a job description.  Now, how does ""supporting the management"" of blablabla work?  

It's not the managing itself because the description is clear: it SUPPORTS the management.  Is there any management of subsistence hunting/trapping/fishing by indigenous people to support?  Seems like there isn't because there is an act that just allows those activities to happen.  Perhaps they mean the opposite: restricting those activities from those who aren't indigenous?  Trouble is, they already have NPS employees that do that...they're called RM-9 rangers or park rangers with LEO privileges.  There's also US Park Police.  But let's be clear here for a moment...you don't need a special line item to fund what you already have and this is already a silly reach to try to explain what this is.

So, how does one get one of these plum $200,000 jobs to ""support the management"" of something that needs no management and has never had management?",1739917905.0,2025-02-18 23:31:45,Conservative

Every, single, one.  I can't mention any of the wasteful spending because every one of them is related to race?

Personally, I don't give a single shit about race.  I didn't bring it up.  You did you racist asshole.  I brought up how there's funding for positions that pay FAR more than what a ranger typically gets paid for sites that have virtually no visitation and for which, in one example, what's there now is a single bronze plaque on a building the NPS doesn't own, lease or pay to maintain.

There was a third item I mentioned in my post but clearly, nobody expects someone like you to actually exert an ounce of effort before blurting out patently stupid shit like you did.  That third item was creating positions from nothing, that pay on average $200,000/yr, that do essentially nothing.  They're there to ""recognize"", ""support"" and ""ensure focus"" on something the NPS doesn't actually do or provide (indigenous hunting/fishing/trapping) that's been happening for years and years without the necessity of these positions.

It's waste, pure and simple.  Want to take a guess as to why every single one of these obviously wasteful projects is also, coincidentally I'm sure, linked to race?

That's one month of expenses that I would consider to be unnecessary for a president that is almost as much as the yearly budget you linked here for the NPS budget with hundreds of thousands of people potentially targeted.

There are no expenses for property they don't own and they even direct visitors who DO want info to visit a site they DO maintain 11 miles away.  Think with a practical mind for a moment.  Choose either private site and say you want to station a ranger there.  Are you going to have that ranger stand outside on the sidewalk?  There has to be a place for their FTE staff to actually, you know, do their job.  I can't make this any more plain: there IS no such place.

And, I didn't allocate anything.  I repeated what THEY said the money is for.  THEY ALLOCATED IT TO FTE, not me.  And what I did was go with the LEAST costly option for what an FTE is.  If I did go with the actual explanation, the proposed employees will number more than what they quoted because there will be P/T staff making up what would usually be a single F/T slot.  Guess what doesn't come into play with P/T staff: benefits, PTO, etc that you alluded to that I was missing.  We can include them if you like but it just makes the math worse.  I went with the least possible costly option.

You can keep trying to defend this however you like but to do so you'll need to take other factors into account that the NPS doesn't claim and you'll need to ignore a lot of obvious, real world circumstances that destroy the stance you're trying to take.  The monument hasn't needed staff in the previous 2 years because the monument doesn't operate with staff, has no place for them and nothing for them to do.

The line item in this budget was to establish FTE positions and allocating funding to them when the positions don't actually exist.  Does that sound familiar given what we've all learned recently about USAID?  Do you think that something like the NPS can't be abused for the same thing?

Copied from my post below:  This whole bullshit argument presupposes that shutting down a bureaucracy is somehow sedition. If the president didnt agree with the actions taken by doge, those acts would be seditious as it wouldn’t be under color of authority.  The president’s authority under article ii section i of the US constitution is ‘chief executive’ with authority vested in him to perform his duties.  as such, he is directly charged with taking care that the laws are carried out. As part of that, his removal power (while implied) is broadly and historically understood.

This is basically a bunch of retards trying to make sections of US code fit their headcanon. When lay people read the us code with a highlighter this is the kind of dumbassery you get.

Its kind of like how they change ‘fascist’ to mean ‘people who arent liberals’ and think that has meaning to the rest of the planet.

This is because the scope of what the federal government does has absolutely exploded in that time, taking on all kinds of powers not granted in the constituation. We've got the FDA (Food & Drug Administration), the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), the ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms) and many more. Nowhere in the Constitution is the federal government given authority to regulate all this stuff; to the contrary, the 10th amendment says that it *doesn't* have that authority. Nevertheless after about almost a century of the 10th amendment basically being ignored everyone is pretty much used to it.

Why is the above paragraph relevant? It's because 535 members of Congress don't have near enough time to actually legislate all the minutiae required by such a vast array of tasks and chores. So instead they just pass a law directing the President to appoint people to take care of it. This has gone on for many decades so that now we find ourselves in a situation where POTUS has an insanely powerful amount of control over all kinds of things the framers never intended.

But at least the President is chosen by a (mostly) Democratic process, so at least we can say he's representing the will of the people, in an indirect manner. For what it's worth Trump's approval rating is finally above water, the first time it's been positive in 12 years. So the people who voted for him seem to be mostly approving of what he's been up to.

If Congress didn't want the President to have such a level of control they'd need to pass legislation to dissolve those dozens of agencies and bureaucracies. Because the President's job is to carry out the will of Congress, and Congress has previously established the creation of all the bureaus. 

Whenever the President (whoever he happens to be) signs an executive order, it can always be traced back to a bill of Congress that he can say he's enforcing. And so many of those bills give the President very wide powers to do things like establish tariffs, limit immigration, send troops to attack enemies, and so on.

Also, the government is not a thing in the constitution. There is a president and a vice president. And that's it. 

No mention of secretaries. 

In here, the government is a real thing. It's made of the prime minister and other ministers.

The parlement can vote and habilitation law requiring the government to write down the law for it. It is mainly used for technical issues or important rewriting of laws. We had our civil code rearaged and partly rewritten this way in 2022.

We have codes of law with articles that beguin with a letter. By order of generaties and specifications: l for loi, r for reglementation, d for decree.

Law is what is voted by the parlement. It's often precised that the precise rules be later determined by reglementation taken by the ministery of whatever it is about. 

The number after the letter will be the same.

Example among thousands. Art.L4311-1 of the public health code qualifies who is to be considered a nurse. 
Art. R.4311-1 and following are the rules of that activity and the precise nomenclature of what qualifies as a nurse job. 

It's not that silly. It's about who is in charge of what. And what can a nuse be blamed for in the exercice of his profession.

You can bet it's not the MP who has written down these. 

There are many modern ways to regulate. This way makes the regulation public for everyone to know it.
I totally get that France and the US have two completely different legal and political systems and traditions. 
But you could find a way to make it clear.

Not exactly true. Here is an excerpt from Article 2, Section 2:

""He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, **shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law**: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.""

So it basically says that Congress can establish by law ""other public ministers"" and Congress can decide which ones require Senate approval (like cabinet heads and major offices) or which ones the President can just pick all by himself -- ""the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.""

So every department, cabinet bureau, etc. was determined by Congress at some point in the past. And Congress has the power to abolish or appeal any of these offices if they want to. In our country's beginning it was a lot smaller but they did exist.",1739403512.0,2025-02-13 00:38:32,Conservative

I can't believe a saw a response that the judiciary decides what is lawful.  That's a fast track to judicial oligarchy.  It *is* someone who has flaired himself as a moderate conservative.  I'm honestly not sure it's worth the trouble to respond.  I can easily write pages of well referenced text, but it doesn't matter if you're taking that activist position.

The judiciary adjudicates and/or provides opinion based on the law.  It doesn't decide what is lawful.  That power is reserved to Congress, though it was weakened with respect to foreign affairs back with FDR.  Article III does allow the unlawful interference with the legal execution of Article II activities.

If the Executive and the Judiciary cannot agree on what is lawful, it is Congress that decides.  It can to it via legislation in some cases.  In a worst-case scenario, if the President refuses to comply with a judicial ruling he believes is unlawful, they can impeach and try him.  Likewise with a judge that abuses the authority given him with unlawful rulings. 

Yes, this can definitely precipitate a crisis.  For something like this?  It might be appropriate to reject the ruling, depending on the specifics of it.  Though, I am glad that the executive made an emergency move to vacate or clarify.  Hopefully, that gets the proper response, though Trump's approach is clearly leaving the option of ignoring the original ruling on the table.  The problem is, I'm hearing mixed messages about the ruling.  If it's really just PII, then the restraining order probably should be respected and due process followed.  If the ruling is overbroad and interferes with even the Sec. of Treasury doing his job, then it's almost an obligation to reject the ruling.

On the other hand, something like Birthright Citizenship *really* does need to follow the full process.  While I agree with Trump's position and believe he will prevail, there is still enough interpretive room that we really want proper precedent set.  Plus, if SCOTUS does strike down Trump, I'm betting it will be in the direction that the power to do this rests with Congress not the President.",1739215615.0,2025-02-10 20:26:55,Conservative

I never once argued that the areas outside of the areas you described weren’t conservative-the problem in California is there’s just not enough conservatives in those areas. They don’t outnumber the population of the blue cities. It doesn’t take rocket science, or “rocket surgery” to understand math-the democrat registered voters outnumber the Republican registered voters by like 4-5 million. The problem is right now, California doesn’t have enough non urban areas with conservative majority to make a difference, especially since Republican voting is so dismal in the cities.

On Wednesday evening, newly installed Attorney General Pam Bondi sent staff in several divisions of the Department of Justice more than a dozen memos within a 15-minute span, laying out the agency’s new policies on issues ranging from reviving the death penalty, to targeting sanctuary cities, to enforcing a strict return-to-office policy.

One astonishing memo, seen by Slate, puts the DOJ at the center of President Donald Trump’s widespread efforts to destroy any traces of initiatives that would create inclusive and diverse workspaces, otherwise known as DEIA. The new memo claims that it will target private-sector diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives for potential “criminal investigation.”

It’s hard to overstate both the constitutional wreckage this crusade will leave in its wake and the havoc it could wreak on the American workforce. In the name of protecting constitutional rights, Bondi’s Justice Department is teeing up an all-out assault on fundamental First Amendment rights to speak, organize, and associate. (A request to the DOJ for more information about the memo had not been responded to as of press time.)

The memo, headed with the subject line “ENDING ILLEGAL DEI AND DEIA DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES,” instructs the Civil Rights Division, historically charged with protecting the rights of vulnerable minorities, and the Office of Legal Policy to take a number of steps to attack any private companies that prioritize diverse workforces through DEIA programs. Bondi has given those departments until March 1 to submit a report with their “recommendations” to “encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including policies relating to DEI and DEIA.”

The memo then asks for a list of business “sectors of concern within the Department of Justice” and the “most egregious and discriminatory DEI and DEIA practitioners in each sector of concern.” It also asks for “litigation activities” and “other strategies” to target these private-sector companies, evidently envisioning a coordinated, agencywide onslaught that would divert many attorneys’ attention away from their normal areas of practice. Bondi says the DOJ will also be working with the Department of Education to make sure that universities are in compliance with the administration’s new anti-DEIA mandate.

Finally, and perhaps most shockingly, the memo implies that some private companies may face criminal penalties for DEIA initiatives. Specifically, Bondi requests that the plan from the Civil Rights Division and Office of Legal Policy include “specific steps or measures to deter the use of DEI and DEIA programs or principles,” as well as “proposals for criminal investigations and up to nine potential civil compliance investigations” of these companies within the “sectors of concern.” The memo specifically cites the section of Trump’s DEIA executive order targeting “publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars.”",1738907804.0,2025-02-07 06:56:44,Conservative

Love it or hate it, thanks to DOGE we're finding out that we were even more ""generous"" than many were previously aware, often for ridiculous or even nefarious purposes.  

  
A good number of the things people want the government to fix aren't any government's job to fix, or even things the federal government has the right to try to fix.

I don't think anyone seriously thinks Trump is trying to annex Canada.  As to Columbia?  Because they refused to take back their citizens who were found to be here illegally.  

Putting the discussion of war at the end, as it got longer than I intended.  Bad habit of mine.



As to war?  Like foreign aid, it should be considered on a case by case basis.  War is terrible.  That it occurs in any situation besides one group seeking to simply exterminate another shows that there are clearly things that people think are worse.

There were people at the time, and some libertarians today, that argued we should have stayed out of the world wars.  Granted, with regard to WW2, the libertarians I've heard argue this are generally only referring to the European theater; they don't say Pearl Harbor should have gone unanswered.

I'm one of the apparent few, even on the right, that believe there was good cause to get involved in Vietnam.  There were steps to be taken that might have prevented the apparent necessity, but arguing from hindsight seems disingenuous.   Loong discussion, but I'll leave it at: much like you've benefitted from growing up in a world where Nazi Germany was defeated, you've benefitted from growing up in a world in which communism was (somewhat) contained, and Vietnam likely played a role in that, even though we technically lost.  

I take less issue with the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan than I do with the decision to stay there for a generation without actually accomplishing meaningful goals.  The desire to avoid the mistakes of the past led to shiny new mistakes.  While there may have been individuals with improper motives, neither were fundamentally started for vanity, oil, Haliburton, or any of the other nonsense that is often claimed.  I'll add that if we actually fought wars to WIN, we wouldn't have needed Iraq 2: Electric Boogaloo.  But we don't, so we did.  

Ukraine?  There were steps we could have taken that may have prevented it; having let it happen, we shouldn't simply hand out money and equipment without getting anything in return, or (again) having a definable, achievable goal in mind.  

Outside of specific conflicts, I'll say that we enjoy significant benefits from being the world's sole superpower, and that maintaining that status may at times require intervening in foreign affairs or conflicts.  Though, I'll qualify that by saying that we should try to  make sure that such intervention is morally justifiable; that is, unless failure to do so would result in unacceptable risk, we shouldn't support overtly evil regimes.",1738793055.0,2025-02-05 23:04:15,Conservative

This comment seems to diverge significantly from your first, and I'm still curious as to whom you were refering to as the ""least of us.""

As to this most recent comment:  

  
I don't watch much network news, anymore.  Politicians deflecting questions is hardly a problem exclusive to or even more common with the right.  I'd need a specific examples of the (presumably) feigned anger your talking about; there may be times I would agree with you, but it may well be related to something I addressed in a recent post- 

""I'm just asking questions"" is quite often simply a cover, used to mask dishonest or insulting claims.  ""Senator, why do you rape children and hate the elderly?""  It'd be hard for me to condemn someone for getting irritated by that.

Look to AskReddit, or any other sub flooded since Trump's inauguration.  ""Why do you support Nazis?"" ""How can you support LITERAL Hitler,"" etc.  While Reddit provides an abundance of recent examples, insults and accusations disguised as questions aren't a recent thing, and are hardly uncommon.  

That's an aspect of Trump's style I enjoy, actually.  He doesn't seem to get ruffled when journalists engage in this sort of dishonesty, he calls it out and moves on.  

Even if I prefer his reaction, it's a bit far to say that getting irritated at a supposed journalist for dealing in bad faith is comparable to, or as pressing an issue as, that bad faith dealing.",1738790209.0,2025-02-05 22:16:49,Conservative

While you, oddly, give farmers as an example of the least among us, modern farmers don't actually fit any of your apparent criteria: dumbest, weakest, most vulnerable.  Modern agriculture is dominated by wealthy, sophisticated ag companies which have a fair amount of power.

Even if they did qualify, you haven't explained how anger in the face of a question (your example of how conservatives play to the least among us) necessarily plays to them.  

  
You also seem to make a few assumptions which aren't necessarily true.

Well, that's silly of them, but you can hardly say their mistaken belief is a result of him ""playing to them"" when he repeatedly and clearly said he intended to start mass deportations.  

Wow, for someone who seems opposed to the deportations, you're making a lot of disparaging assumptions regarding illegal immigrants. Why is ""dumb"" a requirement for manual labor?  

What does a potential dismantling of the DoE have to do with illegal immigrant labor?  It really seems like you're not following a coherent thought process here, just repeating headlines you've read, hoping that they make sense together.  

""Full of racist generalizations of immigrants only being criminals"" is proof you don't actually READ the sub. First, the comments you refer to specifically refer to ILLEGAL immigrants.  Next, the claim that those who illegally enter the country are criminals is true by definition.  It has literally nothing to do with race; we are not in favor of Swedes entering illegally either.  This is called ""projection.""

On the other hand, YOU *do* seem to tie illegal immigration to race, and go on to imply that they are necessarily stupid, and that we should exploit their vulnerability to use them as cheap labor.  Don't try to pin your bigotry on others. You should really read the OP again; that you include this nonsense on THIS post is simply hilarious.

That you struggle to express yourself coherently isn't a moral failing, but it shows that you aren't nearly educated enough to speak so condescendingly regarding the education or intelligence of others.

Should it be relevant, in light of the Constitution?  No.

It's an executive agency.  He is the sole executive.  While Congress can provide the necessary tools and infrastructure for the executive to execute the laws, requiring he use them is likely a step to far.

The idea of an independent executive agency is Constitutionally nonsensical, despite the fact that both parties seem to have accepted it. 

That said, for the last century or so, the legislature has consistently tried to shirk their duties by unconstitutionally delegating legislative authority to these executive agencies, something SCOTUS has been entirely too permissive of.  While granting the agencies this authority, they simultaneously seek to usurp a bit of executive authority and retain some control of them, though these attempts at controls mostly become apparent when a republican is in office.  

  
In addition to his other Constitutional duties, he role is to execute the law.  If Congress passes a law saying 'student's whose parents' income is below x are to receive education grants from this fund,' the President's role is to ensure those funds are dispersed accordingly.  He isn't obligated to use particular personnel or a specific agency to do so, and attempts to create such obligations is arguably beyond the legislature's authority.  

""We appropriate x funds for y purpose,"" arguably creates no obligation at all, other than that the specified funds not be used for other purposes. Using the above example, if an appropriation is made for education grants, but no law is passed requiring such grants be dispersed, failing to disperse grants isn't an issue. That a particular agency has adopted a policy to act as though such a law had been passed, and/or that Congress might have specifically delegated the authority to essentially legislate by determining the policy itself, is irrelevant.  Congress didn't have the power to delegate that authority.  

  
What the court says?  Who knows.  Even otherwise conservative justices have too often basically thrown their hands up and said, ""well, it's not what the Constitution says, but there's no fighting the system now!""",1738704561.0,2025-02-04 22:29:21,Conservative

Medicaid tends to be exceedingly wasteful because it's 100% free to the patient with no co-pay.  Obviously if someone is legitimately destitute and needs medical care, you don't want them to die.  But it's abused a lot.  You can't charge a Medicaid patient for a no show and so there are a lot of Medicaid no-shows.  And if someone might opt for the less expensive treatment if they had to pay for some of it themselves, they have no incentive to do that with Medicaid.

Anyway ...

If you're doing a sex change with private health insurance, you're probably paying a pretty penny (if it's even covered at all).  If you're doing it with Medicaid, it's free.  (Well, not any more.)",1738245435.0,2025-01-30 14:57:15,Conservative

However, you can read the constitution yourself, it’s in very clear English unlike some modern laws. 14th amendment. 

“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”

Constitution supersedes any law or EO, and the language is extremely clear. I think this is dead on arrival legally, doesn’t even seem close. 

Given amendment is very hard, accomplishing this goal is mostly  about reducing illegal immigration, which he does have tools to work on and is.

Sort of.  Remember, most laws are local, not federal.  Laws against theft and murder, for example.  These are state laws, not national laws.  For most crimes, one only falls in the higher jurisdiction if they're crossing state lines in the act(there's more nuance to it, but that's the gist).

Look at it practically.  A legal visitor may have different tax law, cannot vote, cannot run for federal office, cannot be drafted, etc.

They are not *subject* to those.  They do not have bound duty, allegiance, loyalty, etc to the nation.  You can't try a non-citizen as treasonous, in theory.  They can't be traitors to the U.S. because they're *not* U.S. citizens.

A lot of people overlook the term ""subject"" as it was understood at the time, and as it is used in the 14th.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subjection

>one that is placed under authority or control: such as

...

>owing obedience or allegiance to the power or dominion of another

...

>to bring under control or dominion : subjugate  
>to make (someone, such as oneself) amenable to the discipline and control of a superior  
>to make liable : predispose  
>to cause or force to undergo or endure (something unpleasant, inconvenient, or trying)

A visitor is not a subject of the U.S. government, not subject to various aspects of allegiance.

According to that perspective, the U.S. cannot claim one's offspring as a subject merely for being born here.

(I mean, anyone ""can"" do anything, but it is not considered ethical, legal, or whatnot, but that's a pedantic sort of tangent)

The text of the 14th again for reference:

>All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.

>and subject to the jurisdiction thereof

That part I repeated was included for a reason.  It is an exclusive statement, it *excludes* subjects of other jurisdictions.  If it is inclusive, then it need not be present as it is meaningless. ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" would be fine.

All visitors should be similar to diplomats, [their children born here are not U.S. citizens by default](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-7-part-o-chapter-3), for the same reason, they're not obligated to be, they have other obligations, or allegiances, claimed by their country of origin. [I am not arguing that all visitors, legal and not, have 'diplomatic immunity', only talking about the status of their children born here.]

Citizenship is not merely a right, it is a legal status and positive claim of the government that convey rights *and* responsibilities.

Visitors do not have all the same rights/responsibilities as Citizens.  It stands to reason that their children be born with the same status as their parents.  Adding obligation by virtue of the location of birth is the government claiming that child has responsibilities(or will have once adults).


That's the gist of the argument.

I favor the argument, but that's not how the U.S. Gov. treats it currently.",1737468166.0,2025-01-21 15:02:46,Conservative

Now, as it is clear in the law that one cannot derive benefit from illegal acts (can't profit from a crime basically; you lose money on a drug deal, you can't sue for damages, as an example)... This would very clearly imply that such permanent residence must be legal.

Spoiler alert: I am an English teacher with a BA in English Literature. 

Don't even get me started with ""American vernacular"". Do you know how many variants of the English language exist in the United States alone? 

Then let's address the elephant in the room: the language comes from, and arguably belongs to, the United Kingdom. Not that they can make their minds up about what it is either. They have multiple regional accents and *socio-ecnomic* accents not only across their country but in each nook and cranny of London. 

Also, ""English"" as it were, is spoken in a lot of other places, and often in ways Americans would find incomprehensible.

There are reasons the founding fathers didn't do this.",1740805711.0,2025-03-01 06:08:31,news

Is the inevitable progress that all these ""judge rules against Trump for X"" stories that they go up appeals until they land at the supreme court, where they'll be ruled on by people most of whom were given a job for life by Trump?

I'd assume appeals process isn't free? There must be costs involved for everyone involved. Is the chain of appeals all paid for by the US tax payers?

Does this mean we won't know what the real extent of this until the supreme court rules and, if they somehow rule against Trump, he then decides whether to ignore them or not, right?

Aren't the courts and Congress in uproar that so much of the process is being circumvented by executive orders?

The other five justices decided the appeal was premature and they would not rule on the case at this time.

As for congress, half of the members are upset yet like time and time before fail to take any meaningful action and only say they will fight but sit comfy where they are. The other half sees this as an opportunity to seize the loyalty of the radical evangelical Christian voters who believe God put Trump in office, as well as earning favor towards Trump who is backed by the richest people in the world and is very receptive to praise.

The one thing that even most Americans miss is that the way our federal court system works is that it can only resolve “actual cases or controversies”. Trump can’t just ask the Supreme Court if a law he doesn’t like is unconstitutional, he has to break it to generate an “actual case or controversy” that the Supreme Court can rule on. Those cases start in federal district court. Trump expects to lose in District Court and wants to appeal to the Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court. 

Trump being Trump, he’s going to do it in the most dramatic, strongman like way possible, but that’s what he is doing and why. He will also make lots of noise when he loses because that’s to his political benefit as well.

However, EEO Employers are prohibited from hiring (or NOT hiring) someone based on their race/ethnicity/gender/disabled status/veteran status.

At the end of the day, the regulations specifically stated that the most qualified applicant should be chosen for the job regardless of their demographics. 

What employers are (or were, prior to the EO) required to do is analyze their workforce composition and determine if any race or gender groups are not properly represented based on a statistical analysis which considers the US Census Bureau data in their recruitment area. These employers are also expected to make good faith efforts in reaching out to organizations that help find diverse candidates to help get their foot in the door for the interview. They still have to he a qualified applicant. What employers are NOT doing is hiring someone simply because they fill a quota for Asians. That would be illegal.

IF all 3 applicants are truly equally qualified, responsive and have made a good impression during the interview process, then you should have no problem with the black woman being selected. Any of these individuals could be selected since in your example, they are all equally qualified. 

HOWEVER, if you know as a hiring manager that your company has performed an analysis and knows that either black individuals or females (or both) are underrepresented in your total workforce, then it makes the most logical sense to choose the black female, yes. No one is saying you are required to hire the black female. You could also hire either of the other applicants and this would not be a problem, so long as you can show that there was no discrimination happening against the others. This is not to say that employers should be weeding out their applicant pools to only consider those particular underrepresented groups - because again, that would be ILLEGAL.

The regulations required employers to look at ALL of their applicants and hires to determine if there was any disparity in their selection rates. Say you have 300 black applicants, and 12 white applicants, but you hired 10 white and 2 black individuals. That would be a red flag based on the ratio of applicants to actual hires. Surely you can see how those who were hired do not reflect the race and gender makeup of the total pool of applicants. This is where you would look back at the applicant pool and identify that the majority of the applicants were simply not qualified and not considered for the job, and that they were not disqualified purely based on their race or gender (which would be discrimination).

I will reverse the situation. Say you have a white male who is perfectly qualified and capable of the job. An Asian male who is also qualified, with maybe less on the job experience than the white male. And thirdly you have the black female who has no experience and is not qualified for the job. But you hire the black female to fill your ‘quota’. THAT IS ILLEGAL. That would be a problem and something to rage about. But that’s not happening in reality.

The regulations that were in place were not designed to get employers in trouble if they didn’t hire females or minorities in every singular hiring instance. No one has time for that. And these regulations only applied to employers who entered into federal contracts worth a certain amount of money. If you want money from the federal government, you should anticipate needing to follow their rules and regulations. 

Do you see how there are multiple moving parts to this issue? There is a lot of nuance to consider and simply tearing down the system is not the way to fix the problem.",1740505463.0,2025-02-25 18:44:23,news

I realize you conceded the possibility that there was no discrimination, but I don’t want the feds to be on employer’s asses just because a couple ratios are not to some people’s liking. That will just cause employers to do things like always hiring the black woman in my precious scenario, as nobody wants to deal with the headaches that can ensue from a discrimination claim.

I did not personally work in HR nor did I assist in making any hiring decisions. I simply collected the data and performed the analysis via a computer program. So I’m not involved in the hiring process whatsoever.

What I can tell you is that a company like my prior employer simply collects the data points, and performs a statistical analysis, then presents it to the client to dissect the results and determine if they need to adjust their processes. 
We do solicit data on whether the applicant was qualified or not or otherwise not eligible for consideration and those specific individuals would be removed from the pool. Leaving you with only the pool of actual qualified candidates. Naturally there is room for human error or bias to influence these results.

I am not trying to insinuate that underrepresentation alone would qualify as discrimination. But performing these analyses can reveal preliminary biases or disparity which can lead to an investigation that may uncover more obvious or widespread cases of discrimination. I’m not aware of any EEOC discrimination case which lead to any sort of punishment or reconciliation agreement based SOLELY on underrepresentation.

They see someone like Hunter and they think “wow she’s hot” (but likely in a more invasive and gross way)

When they find out that they are trans that sends them into a tail spin because they were attracted to a “man” 

Then they get angry because “I’m not gay! You’re gay!!” (Also likely in a less articulate way)

There’s this idea in some of these guys heads that it’s dishonest and a “trick”. They think well if no one can tell anyone’s “real” gender then what is protecting me from taking home a “man”

So this hypothetical mid 60’s bald overweight under educated white man thinks that “when” he picks up someone like Hunter in a bar his sexuality will be harmed.

Conservatives believe that certain groups are inherently superior to others.

E.g. Men are superior to women; and women should be subordinate to men.

The very existence of transgender women threatens this way of thinking; as there is no way to reconcile ‘men’ voluntarily surrendering their superior status to become inferior women.

And rather than choosing to abandon a belief system contradicted by evidence, conservatives are choosing instead to erase the evidence.

(Literally, and genocidally.)

…

Some additional notes:

* This is also why conservatives recast the actions of trans women back into traditional gender norms. E.g.: trans women seek bathroom access for predatory purposes.

* This is also why they rarely talk about *trans men;* and why they invoke the specter of ‘mutilation’ when they do. (Because they must be ‘women’ that have been tricked into harming their own physical attractiveness.)

The state received $53 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for fiscal year 2025 as part of the regular yearly allocation for the LIHEAP program. Community action agencies are currently providing emergency assistance with home heating bills to eligible households through that funding, which can range from $280-$550.

My friend who watched right wing media knew what was at stake and voted for Kamala against his party affiliation.

His words have been plastered everywhere, with right wingers saying ""this will be awesome"" and everyone else understanding the terrifying implications of what kept coming out of his mouth. Propaganda would've been more effective if they hadn't posted clips of him at all, but right wing media did because they LOVE the hate coming out of his mouth. It embodies who they are. So if a person saw this and still didn't care, their fault, our problem. We always ask in history why the Germans let Hitler do what he did, passivity. fucking. kills.

THAT'S being pedantic, and you did nothing but hand wave over the comparison so I figured I'd math it out for you.

They can tell us get fucked all they want. If they're going to complain about something they could've had a choice in but they abstained, they're getting fucked too. ""Get fucked"" are just words.

The Establishment Clause, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, prohibits the government from establishing an official religion or **favoring one religion over others**.

Knowing his administration's inability to do things in a subtle way, it won't be long before this office makes their bias for Christianity plainly known, and then the lawsuits will roll in. What happens after that? Only baby Jesus knows.",1739250902.0,2025-02-11 06:15:02,news

Also, going to oversimplify this, but I was taught being wealthy is kind of a sin. Being rich isn’t necessarily a sin, but it calls into question if a person is taking advantage of others or has an inappropriate love of money/material items. If someone is wealthy they should be ensuring their wealth goes to stewardship and acts of service. It‘s basically „live humbly and modest. Help others“.

Dear Members and Supporters of The Satanic Temple,

As Inauguration Day approaches, we find ourselves at a crucial juncture in our nation’s history. New initiatives aimed at redefining Constitutional values pose a serious threat to religious freedom and bodily autonomy. This makes The Satanic Temple’s commitment to defending our members’ liberties more important than ever.

With the 2025 legislative session now underway, there is a rising movement to integrate religious doctrine into public education and restrict religious practices. Proposals to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms, introduce biblical teachings, and appoint campus chaplains threaten the principle of keeping public institutions free from any one religious tradition. Additionally, efforts to limit abortion access through misleading mandates and new barriers undermine personal autonomy. Each legislative challenge reinforces our belief that the pursuit of justice must prevail over laws and institutions.

As extremist lawmakers draw strength from the shifting political landscape, we are empowered by the collective resolve of our members and community. We will continue defending the religious freedom of our members and expanding access to abortion—a right inseparable from our religious beliefs—as exemplified by the recent opening of TST Health’s second Satanic abortion clinic in Virginia. 

We invite you to stand with us. In the coming weeks, we will call upon those who volunteered after the election to take meaningful action as we move forward. Together, we will develop our next steps.

Stay informed by visiting our new Livestream Page, where you can access our upcoming schedule of live discussions and legal updates. Moving forward, our Legal Updates Livestreams will be broadcast on our website and Facebook, ensuring that all supporters remain up to date and prepared for the challenges ahead.

Your ongoing support is crucial to our fight against theocratic forces. By donating today, you help ensure that we can continue defending the civil rights and religious freedoms of our members, both now and in the future.

The challenges before us will test the very principles upon which this nation was founded. With your support, The Satanic Temple will rise as defenders of Constitutional values, championing religious liberty and demonstrating what authentic patriotism looks like in the face of theocratic threats to our fundamental freedoms.

A lot of the court cases against it were by Christian students and parents who being of different denominations didn’t fucking like it. 

it’s kind of a big deal. There’s a reason why up until around 400 years ago, people were still burning the entire goddamn European continent down over this shit.

Definitions vary where sometimes catholics are included when referring moreso to older denominations or ones you'd typically find on a ""main street"" in town. Other times it refers more to [Protestants that are more progressive or liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_Protestant). [Mariann Edgar Budde](https://www.npr.org/2025/01/21/nx-s1-5270031/bishop-mariann-edgar-budde-confronts-trump-in-sermon) who had her sermon during the [inauguration prayer](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/01/21/president-donald-trump-live-updates-cabinet-executive-orders/77840414007/) service would also be part of this group as an Episcopal. Catholics are a mixed bag depending on the issue, but the key thing is that mainline generally describes denominations that have values that tend to run counter to what you hear described about evangelicals (and arguably match up more with what's actually in the Bible when it comes to taking care of others or social justice).

[Here's one summary:](https://nyupress.org/9780814753309/mainline-christianity/)

>These denominations have been the dominant cultural representatives since the nineteenth century of how and where the majority of American Christians worship. Today, however, the Seven Sisters no longer represent most American Christians. The Mainline has been shrinking while evangelical and fundamentalist churches, as well as non denominational congregations and mega churches, have been attracting more and more members.

Lutheran would come up because of things like Lutheran Social Services others have mentioned. That's part of the group that's on the decline as these megachurches or other denominations where Christian nationalism is rampant are on the rise. That's not to say mainline churches are immune to it, but especially with Lutherans, there's a lot of priming against what we're seeing in the nation today, especially when it comes to examples with the Pharisees (e.g., hypocritical praying on the street corner for show). That's why many of those denominations are more cautious about being boastful, taking credit for good deeds, the things you see going on with the current federal government. A lot of it runs very counter to their faith.

It may not be the perfect comparison to talk about mainline here, but it's a good opportunity to bring up mainline vs. the relatively newer evangelical movement since people hear the latter often in news, but rarely hear about mainline. It does seem like attacks or othering of mainline denominations is going to be on the rise and is especially ironic when politicians invoke Christianity.",1739248149.0,2025-02-11 05:29:09,news

Over time, many of those offshoot sects fall into the same pattern. Modern-day American Christianity is overwhelmingly not in line with Christ's teachings, which is largely the fault of Evangelicals positioning theirs as *the* mainstream Christian doctrine.",1739245958.0,2025-02-11 04:52:38,news

The 60’s saw what was, in a sense, an explosion of democracy with huge strides being made on the social front. In 1975, a key report was written and sent to the Trilateral Commission, on which Jimmy Carter, Vice President Walter Mondale, the secretaries of State, Defense, and the Treasury were all seated. This report was called “The Crisis of Democracy” and it claimed that in America, the main problem of governance stems from “an excess of democracy.” 

If one goes back even further to the debates at the constitutional convention of 1787, James Madison said that it is the role of government “to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.” 

So, one could actually argue that the game was rigged from the very beginning. The haves will continue to have and the have nots will continue to have nothing. They use rags to riches stories as an appeal to extremes to convince everyone it could actually happen to them.

Ignoring the fact that when that rulings were done, there wasn't any (or at least, very few) cable specific channels. Cable was the kind of thing you were forced to get because the place you live was in a valley and TV signals didn't get down there, so they'd place a giant antenna on the top of the hill and then send the signals down a cable to you. That's why cable is sometimes called 'CATV' - Community Access Television. Reagan deregulated cable in 1984 and that's what led to the major growth of it.

Most other countries around the world regulate cable & satellite under the provision that the cables are dug up under public streets or the signal goes through the countries airspace.

And it wouldn't have stopped things like HBO. Because before HBO there was subscription based broadcast television. And the FCC ruled they could show porn and R rated movies during the day using the justification that the supreme court would later use for cable - that you have to specifically choose to pay for it.

Not that you care.


Gotta love it when people reply to a comment then block the person they responded to so they can’t reply back. But just because you’re special, I’d love for you to tell me what I misstated from my source:

“Significant Findings:

Transgender women performed worse than cisgender women in tests measuring lower-body strength.

Transgender women performed worse than cisgender women in tests measuring lung function.

Transgender women had a higher percentage of fat mass, lower fat-free mass, and weaker handgrip strength compared to cisgender men.

Transgender women’s bone density was found to be equivalent to that of cisgender women, which is linked to muscle strength.

There were no meaningful differences found between the two groups’ hemoglobin profiles. Hemoglobin (Hb) plays a crucial role in athletic performance by facilitating improved oxygen delivery to muscles. Elite endurance athletes may exhibit up to a 40% higher level of Hb compared to untrained individuals. Moreover, heightened levels of Hb typically correlate with enhanced aerobic performance.

Similar findings have been echoed in previous reporting. According to a recent report that generated an in-depth review of all English-language scientific literature (published between 2011-2021) about transgender (trans) women athlete participation in elite sport, several key conclusions coincide with findings from the IOC funded study, including:


Biomedical factors such as lung size, bone density, and hip-to-knee joint angle (q-angle) are not indicative of athletic prowess.

Testosterone levels do not predict athletic performance or overall athleticism.
Conversely, social elements such as nutrition, training regimen, and equipment accessibility significantly influence an athlete’s performance, but are frequently disregarded in policy formulation.
It’s imperative to integrate both biomedical and social scientific insights into policy-making processes. However, there’s a tendency to prioritize biomedical research excessively, which can compromise the overall well-being of athletes.”",1738814520.0,2025-02-06 05:02:00,news

I was a scrub on my highschool boys' JV soccer team. We would scrimmage against the girls' varisty team. We sucked ass and still stomped them. We would play two players down and had to have a ten pass chain before shooting. We would still win by 5+ goals in less than 30 minutes before we called it. And that is with one of the varisty girls' players being the best female striker in the state.


We were shorter, slower, weaker, and less skilled than the boys' varsity by a long shot but we were still taller, faster, and stronger than the girls' varsity team. Skill didn't matter because we could bully them up and down the field.

Life isn't fair. Some women are 6'. Some women have been in the sport since they were 5 and are now 30. Some women have a genetic advantage of growing muscle at higher rates. Honestly, I'll take a few of the trans women as opponents over some of the absolutely insane women who have no mercy. 

>Right now many women are afraid to speak out about this

This keeps getting said, but my group has already decided we're all joining the men's team if they force the trans women there. If women didn't want the trans women there, they'd speak up. We don't need people to put words in our mouths and speak for us.

>In sports like MMA, it's dangerous.

So, my sport is MMA-adjacent. It's, really not? I mean, I mostly fight men because we have a shortage of women and still need to train. Most of us do. Somehow, none of us feel threatened during this type of training.

> So I really don't care if some, because it damn sure ain't all, female athletes are okay with it.

Still, don't speak for us. It's not your business.

>As for your last paragraph, not everything is about you and I can care about more than one problem at a time. Trans people should not be assaulted or harassed. That's totally irrelevant to this discussion.

Yet, these things absolutely are linked. Continuing this scaremongering risks people harassing us at our events and it risks women in women-only spaces like the bathroom if god forbid we don't conform. Constantly demonizing trans women puts me at risk. By the way, I'm not trans.

FOR EVERYONE LOOKING TO TURN YOUR ANGER INTO ACTION

**Here’s some advice from a high-level staffer for a Senator. There are two things that we should be doing all the time right now, and they’re by far the most important things.**

You should NOT be bothering with online petitions or emailing.

1) The best thing you can do to be heard and get your congressperson to pay attention is to have face-to-face time — if they have town halls, go to them.

Go to their local offices.

If you’re in DC, try to find a way to go to an event of theirs. Go to the “mobile offices” that their staff hold periodically (all these times are located on each congressperson’s website).

When you go, ask questions. A lot of them. And push for answers. The louder and more vocal and present you can be at those the better.


2) But those in-person events don’t happen every day. So, the absolute most important thing that people should be doing every day is calling.

—

***YOU SHOULD MAKE 6 CALLS A DAY:***

2 each (DC office and your local office) to your 2 Senators & your 1 Representative.

The staffer was very clear that any sort of online contact basically gets immediately ignored, and letters pretty much get thrown in the trash (unless you have a particularly strong emotional story — but even then it’s not worth the time it took you to craft that letter).

**Calls are what all the congresspeople pay attention to.**

Every single day, the Senior Staff and the Senator get a report of the 3 most-called-about topics for that day at each of their offices (in DC and local offices), and exactly how many people said what about each of those topics.

They’re also sorted by zip code and area code.

She said that Republican callers generally outnumber Democrat callers 4-1, and when it’s a particular issue that single-issue-voters pay attention to (like gun control, or planned parenthood funding, etc...), it’s often closer to 11-1, and that’s recently pushed Republican congressmen on the fence to vote with the Republicans. **In the last 8 years, Republicans have called, and Democrats haven’t.**


**So, when you call:**

***A)*** When calling the DC office, ask for the Staff member in charge of whatever you’re calling about:

- Ex. “Hi, I’d like to speak with the staffer in charge of Healthcare, please”
- Local offices won’t always have specific ones, but they might. If you get transferred to that person, awesome. If you don’t, that’s ok
- Ask for that person’s name, and then just keep talking to whoever answered the phone.
- Don’t leave a message (unless the office doesn’t pick up at all — then you can — but it’s better to talk to the staffer who first answered than leave a message for the specific staffer in charge of your topic).

***B)*** Give them your zip code. They won’t always ask for it, but make sure you give it to them, so they can mark it down. 

- Extra points if you live in a zip code that traditionally votes for them, since they’ll want to make sure they get/keep your vote.

***C)*** If you can make it personal, make it personal. 

- “I voted for you in the last election and I’m worried/happy/whatever” 
- “I’m a teacher, and I am appalled by Betsy DeVos,”
- “as a single mother”
-  etc.

***D)*** Pick 1-2 specific things per day to focus on. Don’t rattle off everything you’re concerned about 

- they’re figuring out what 1-2 topics to mark you down for on their lists. So, focus on 1-2 per day. 
- Ideally something that will be voted on/taken up in the next few days, but it doesn’t really matter 
- Even if there’s not a vote coming up in the next week, call anyway. It’s important that they just keep getting calls.

***E)*** Be clear on what you want — Don’t leave any ambiguity.

- “I’m disappointed that the Senator...” 
- “I want to thank the Senator for their vote on... “
- “I want the Senator to know that voting in _____ way is the wrong decision for our state because... “ 

***F)*** They may get to know your voice/get sick of you — it doesn’t matter. The people answering the phones generally turn over every 6 weeks anyway, so even if they’re really sick of you, they’ll be gone in 6 weeks.

— 

From experience since the election: If you hate being on the phone & feel awkward (which is a lot of people) don’t worry about it. There are a bunch of scripts (Indivisible has some, there are lots of others floating around these days) and after a few days of calling, it starts to feel a lot more natural.

Put the 6 numbers in your phone (all under P – Politician.) An example is Politician McCaskill MO, Politician McCaskill DC, Politician Blunt MO, etc.

This makes it easy to go down the list every day.

**Bottom line: CALLS WORK. SHOW UP. KEEP CALLING.**

First, there was some question as to the congressional voting to adopt the amendment. There may or may not have been enough votes to have passed the amendment through congress due to southern reconstruction, among other things. 

Second, state ratification. The initial pass failed ratification. Southern states were then torn apart, reformed into military districts, then reformed, then they voted again to ratify. The second pass was successful. 

Now, previous SCOTUS rulings have upheld the validity of the 14th multiple times. Basically the argument was ""so what, it is what it is."" This SCOTUS... 


Anyway this shakes out will likely be bad. 


The first part, with the amendment vote in Congress, had to do with the number of votes needed to pass. Does the amendment need 2/3 of the total possible members, or 2/3 of the members present? Big difference! Unclear in the Constitution. 

The second part... reforming states, then instilling new state governments to vote as the federal government wishes... Big Deal! It was accomplished through the insurrection act. Imagine massive riots in California, Illinois, new York, etc. Insurrection act. Dissolve, reform, etc. 


This whole thing should make your butthole pucker.",1738776230.0,2025-02-05 18:23:50,news

Trump may put a lot of loyalists in place, especially in civilian positions, but there are literally thousands of commanders across the branches that retain authority on how to interpret and carry out orders, as well as an obligation to determine whether or not the orders are lawful.

IF the military was called in by Trump to do anything out of the ordinary, especially anything egregious, we could see mass defection/insubordination; especially if their orders were in response to a constitutional crisis.

What we don't know because it's thankfully never happened, is what role the military may/could play should Trump stop beating around the bush and actually openly circumvent the constitution.

So Nixon was technically never impeached, because he resigned before they could take the vote?

>Based on the strength of the evidence presented and the bipartisan support for the articles in committee, House leaders of both political parties concluded that Nixon's impeachment by the full House was a certainty if it reached the House floor for a final vote, and that his conviction in a Senate trial was a distinct possibility.

>On August 5, 1974, Nixon released a transcript of one of the additional conversations to the public, known as the ""smoking gun"" tape, which made clear his complicity in the Watergate cover-up. This disclosure destroyed Nixon politically. His most loyal defenders in Congress announced they would vote to impeach and convict Nixon for obstructing justice. Republican congressional leaders met with Nixon and told him that his impeachment and removal were all but certain. Thereupon, Nixon gave up the struggle to remain in office, and resigned on August 9, 1974. Vice President Gerald Ford succeeded to the presidency in accordance with Section I of the Twenty-fifth Amendment. Although arrangements for a final House vote on the articles of impeachment and for a Senate trial were being made at the time, further formal action was rendered unnecessary by his resignation, so the House brought the impeachment process against him to an official close two weeks later.

Again, I really recommend listening to that episode if you want to get a sense of where he is coming from. He fundamentally believes liberals are more dangerous for black people and it comes from this Malcolm X quote which I'll paraphrase: 

There's two types of white people, the wolf and the fox. With the wolf, you know what you're getting: in your face racism and fucked up jim crow laws and lynchings. But you know what you're getting with them. The fox hides behind liberal ideals but is more dangerous because they try to trick you into thinking they're on your side. The fox's whole schtick is elitism. They want their club to be an exclusive club where certain people are only allowed. But they'll tell everyone that they want an egalitarian society. Thomas just doesn't realize that the wolf is actually the one that's more dangerous. Just because you know what you're getting doesn't mean it stops the *literal terroristic violence* inflicted on black people because they are seen as other-than-human by the wolf. With the fox, it's opinions are subject to change. It can be persuaded because it's a thinking-""animal* as opposed to the wolf's unthinking violence. This is why Malcolm X actually came around to white people at the end of his tragically cut-short life. He realized that there genuinely are white people that want to change the system and make it better for everyone, that there are white people not opposed to integration whatsoever. With the wolf, you get the exact opposite. You can literally never reason with the wolf. It doesn't matter if you know what you're getting if you can't reason with it. Which makes it all the more strange that Thomas still thinks the fox is more dangerous; or maybe, just maybe, the whole wolf-fox paradigm is flawed from its inception.",1738780393.0,2025-02-05 19:33:13,news

The Dems have nothing left to lose at this point. I do think it's a little early to play the impeachment card though. 

Trump will piss people off his own party. He will have a falling out with Elon and that little love affair will end. Terrible economic policies will reverse course on inflation. Middle class constituents will start making noise about high retail good prices and higher tax bills. Unfortunately, this will take time, and there will probably be unrest and violence while it happens.

Jack Ruby was a very violent night club owner who liked to act on impulse. He would actually take people's money at the door to his night club and then beat people up who he disliked. People who knew him described him as someone who acted on the spot. It's not surprising that he got angry and shot Oswald. 

Ruby's own explanation for it was that he didn't want Jackie to relive that day in court.",1737667337.0,2025-01-23 22:22:17,news

Trump issued two executive orders targeting human trafficking. The first, aimed at disbanding transnational criminal organizations that traffic humans, was signed on Feb. 9, 2017.

The second order concerned online child trafficking and sexual exploitation in the United States. It was signed Jan. 31.

Trump tweeted and did interviews that touched upon the human trafficking epidemic in America and one of his agendas was to go after the elite pedophile rings once in office with the hiring of Jeff Sessions and executive orders

Acosta went on record at the time saying he was told by the FBI to let him walk because Epstein ""belonged to Intelligence"" and that this was ""above his pay grade""

As per the Archives and the ARRB texts it's either items already released (like an FBI memo that states the same thing as a CIA memo was release, CIA memo withheld) or items that were included but had no real relevance to the assassination (CIA informants/agents in Cuba). Or redactions related to people still living (or who still have relatives in harm's way). But there's actually records that state why something isn't released submitted from each gov't agency here: [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/agency-doc-2022](https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/agency-doc-2022)

For instance, here's the CIA letter: [https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2022docs/CIA\_2022-8-11\_153622\_D-CIA\_Letter\_12.15.2021.pdf](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2022docs/CIA_2022-8-11_153622_D-CIA_Letter_12.15.2021.pdf)

And their spreadsheet of documents along with entries of why redactions in some documents still needed: [https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2022docs/CIA\_JFK\_Final\_Index\_12-12-2022.pdf](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/2022docs/CIA_JFK_Final_Index_12-12-2022.pdf)

Most of the juicy stuff was released when the Warren Commission records were made available.

\*edited to add:

The only really interesting thing might be in the archives already, they refer to it in their postponement letter:

>Two cartridges housing hi-yield typewriter ribbons in the CIA Segregated Collection within the records of the HSCA. The ribbons may contain classified information and NARA is developing a process to safely unspool the cartridges, convert the information to a digital format, and prepare a transcription to facilitate review. Pursuant to section 5(g)(2)(D) of the JFK Act, NARA requests postponement of the two hi-yield typewriter ribbon cartridges.

And the Senate did that open examination during the Cold War, so of course back then you had people saying it would threaten our security and all the stuff that I'm sure people will be parroting on this thread. 


But I'd just have them ask themselves, do you think we are better off knowing more and learning about things like MK Ultra and being able to weigh in, or was it wrong for us to know like they're saying it's wrong for us to be more informed now. 


If an informed electorate is necessary to the survival of the State as our founders believed, then we really need to open up that closet and see wtf our government has been doing. 


Like we have secret documents from the 50s that still haven't been unreleased. Bush Jr even went back and classified already released documents. Which I find insane. 


I've been a big proponent that we need to recalibrate and have our congress do something like the Church committee hearings every 10 years. The public needs to know what's being done. It's hard to have a clear view of reality when everything is cloak and dagger.

Trump is about to declare that we are under invasion by foreign force composed of the illegal immigrants. 

The exception to Birth Right Citizenship is anyone who is not under the laws and jurisdiction of the United States. So the child of a diplomat who is here with diplomatic immunity (not subject to our laws as a result) does not gain citizenship under the 14th amendment. Similarly, the children of an invading force are not automatically citizens either. 

Recently, Texas Gov. Abbot attempted to claim Texas didn't have to follow federal law because he had declared that they were under invasion by an alien force, the illegal aliens. This got overturned, but in a way that made it kind of clear that the president COULD make such a declaration.

I am going to explain this in a bit of detail, because while I agree with what you are saying in spirit, we need to understand the technicisms and ways in which they are trying to do this to fight it.

Basically the 14th amendment, added after the civil war to integrate black slaves as citizens and undo the infamous Dredd Scott v Sandford (this one is going to matter in a bit).

So the part of the amendment that is pertinent to this (emphasis mine)

> All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and **subject to the jurisdiction thereof**, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.

So lets understand a bit what this law is **actually** saying. It says that anyone born on US soil is an American citizen *except those that have **explicitly** been delcares outside of the jurisdiction of the US*, which is basically foreign leaders, diplomats and ambassadors (basically diplomatic immunity is also immunity from gaining US citizen which could be detrimental to people from certain countries so this avoids that).

So basically, if any US police force (including state police, FBI, Secret Service and **ICE**) could arrest you where you gave birth, your baby is a US citizen.

So what they are trying to say is that you are only in US jurisdiction if the US knows of your entry into the US. If you did not enter through a port of entry, and do not have documentation, then you are not under US jurisdiction.

This is a huge question. Can you arrest someone who is not under juridiction? Would this argument then imply that undocumented immigrants cannot be arrested, nor deported as no police force has the authority (I guess the coast guard, as the one army that can interact within US soil with non-invaders could, but they cannot leave the coast!). It shouldn't be like lawless (which means that the person has no protection from the law anymore, no consequences to anything you do to them) and even then most of that was born because (due to Texas not wanting to get rid of slaves) there was territory that no state in the US wanted to have, which made it a no man's (as no owner) land, it's the Oklahoma panhandle!

And this means there's a loophole to the legal protections for citizens. I can choose any random person and assume they are ~~guilty~~ outside of the jurisdiction that would cover a US citizen until proven otherwise. I can arrest anyone, infringe their rights, and then when called out that this was invalid just say ""sorry, I though this was in that weird half-jurisdiction"".

So yeah this is horrible. This is basically the foundation to recreate a new slave-class in the US.",1737669963.0,2025-01-23 23:06:03,news

His jurisdiction is the US District Court for Western Washington, which is basically the lowest level of federal courts. You may have heard of the Southern District of New York before? That's the same level of federal court. 

The reason this came before Judge Coughenour is because the Attorney General of Washington, who is based in the Western District of Washington is suing over the order because of its effect on Washington citizens and residents. (things like losing federal money for benefits based on numbers of people and a few others) The claim is that it is unconstitutional though, the effects it has just gives the attorney general the right to sue over it.

To answer your question succinctly, any federal district court could rule on this issue. It's actually the very first step of litigating law. Then it gets appealed to increasingly higher courts until it lands at the Supreme Court eventually.

Several times below it's said that US District Judges are the lowest level of federal judge. That's true but shouldn't be taken to mean ""least powerful."" 

An Article III District Judge - any of them, every one of them - wields the entire authority of the US government at the tip of their pen. My dad used to say there is no person in the entire government more powerful than an Art III District Judge. They typically only wield that power over the parties to the case before them, but sometimes those parties include an entire State or even the US Government itself. Example, Frank Minis Johnson, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Minis_Johnson, issued sweeping injunctions to desegregate multiple institutions in Alabama, singlehandedly achieving civil rights milestones over the objections of an entire State. 

Appellate courts and the Supreme Court can reverse a District Judge; other District Courts may disagree and make different rulings; and other coequal branches can perhaps try to disregard a ruling (we'll see some of that pretty soon I think).

Thus, the Indian Citizenship Act plugs a well-described hole in the 14th Amendment’s guarantee to birthright citizenship. Besides, the interaction between Native American sovereignty and the US has a legal history full of precedent that doesn’t exist for undocumented and temporary immigrants.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has actually answered in clear detail what circumstances can limit conferral of birthright citizenship. From *US v Wong Kim Ark:*

> The foregoing considerations and authorities irresistibly lead us to these conclusions: the Fourteenth Amendment affirms the ancient and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory, in the allegiance and under the protection of the country, including all children here born of resident aliens, with the exceptions or qualifications (as old as the rule itself) of children of foreign sovereigns or their ministers, or born on foreign public ships, or of enemies within and during a hostile occupation of part of our territory, and with the single additional exception of children of members of the Indian tribes owing direct allegiance to their several tribes.

Note that the parents don’t need to be considered resident aliens to have their children count, since that is a category within the umbrella of “all,” in the event Trump tries to argue that undocumented immigrants somehow don’t count as resident aliens due to being undocumented. I do think we can all guess what Trump will try to argue here - he’ll jettison those here on temporary documents and claim that the vast numbers of undocumented immigrants constitutes a hostile occupation, with any nation whose people are coming here counting as enemies. Even with our current Supreme Court, I don’t see that argument flying.",1737666886.0,2025-01-23 22:14:46,news

However, the government defending the EO can appeal the restraining order to the court of appeals and eventually the Supreme Court, without ruling on the merits of the case, rather the upper courts would simply determine if the restraining order against the EO is a reasonable step to take. The 9th circuit Court of appeals is highly likely to keep the order in place and have the district court continue the arguments in the case on the constitutional questions. 

The upper courts could however decide that the restraining order is not in order and then the EO would be in effect during the trial. But you can basically consider these two separate paths.

Don't you think if there was any it would have already happened and Trump wouldn't have got elected again? Even before the 2024 election there was only a thin veil. No one on the right is hiding anything at this point. At this time the only recourse I see is an uptick in violence against the people (such as the UHC person) in charge to try to 'scare' them into things...but obviously that is not the correct or virtuous answer and would probably not go how one thinks it would. (they don't learn, they just double down). Voting has proven to be a point that isn't going to change anything when the people involved have zero integrity.

I see things getting worse the next 4 years, and in that time, if we still have a democracy, I do not see it getting better. I see it continuing down the same path because talking doesn't do ANYTHING as we've seen.

They are immune to our laws thus unable to be granted the right to be a citizen. If we are unable to confine, impression, charge, tax and fine a person well then it goes to argue they are not subject to the privileges of citizenship.

The question then is"" When does one become a citizen?"" Is it when they are born, when they file their first income tax, or maybe when a parent or guardian pays a tax or fee on their behalf. If we were citizens of another country and we did not uphold the laws of the jurisdictions we were in, could it be found that we would then be deported. Would a minor, who has no citizenship elsewhere nor hold any diplomat ties, then be assumed to be a member of the society they were born into. When did I or you become a citizen? 

What we fail to utilize, since this whole exploration is at the root about money, is that if we make people citizens then we can expect due payment for the services each jurisdiction provides.

In 2000, Bush, Gore and Lieberman all said they opposed it, with Gore even boasting about the Defense of Marriage Act.

He was the first candidate until after 2008 to actually support a same-sex couple's right to marry.  (And if you think about it, isn't that true conservatism?

* The lawsuit specifically mentions how children denied citizenship under this EO would likely end up stateless

* There are states and cities that allow mothers to anonymously abandon their newborns in designated locations. If this EO were allowed to take effect as-is, would that mean these children have indeterminate citizenship?

* While this EO is written to direct federal agencies to re-interpret the 14th amendment like this only for children born more than 30 days from when it was signed, if SCOTUS actually upheld the order,  such a deadline would make no sense. A ruling in Trump's favor would mean the 14th amendment never applied to people born to parents who lack citizenship or permanent residency.
* While this EO is too extreme even for this SCOTUS, I wouldn't put it past them to reject it in a way that lets Trump try again (similar to the Muslim ban from his first term).",1737485616.0,2025-01-21 19:53:36,news

Frederick Trump, Donald Trump's grandfather, returned to Germany briefly in the early 1900s, only to be expelled when German authorities discovered he had left the country to avoid mandatory military service. As a result, he was effectively forced to settle permanently in the United States. At the time, U.S. immigration processes were far more lenient than today, relying primarily on passenger manifests and basic inspections at ports of entry. 

This raises an ironic hypothetical: if the revocation of natural citizenship is enacted, then a reasonable line of reasoning would be - we can then question the citizenship status of the sitting president’s ancestor and thus the sitting president himself.  Was Frederick Trump genuinely a U.S. citizen, or simply a young man evading Germany’s conscription, inadvertently placing himself in a state of practical ""statelessness"" and thus his  descendants?

At the moment, the process of obtaining a Birth certificate usually starts by the hospital and is signed off by the State.  Before the EO, everyone at the hospital was born in the State gets a Birth Certificate.  
The EO is worded that the parents involved are illegal, but there is no way for the State to know the legality status of the parents. Now do this in 50 States and 5 Territories. This puts an undue/unfunded burden on the State. 

States have their own laws pertaining to a birth certificate, and what if a State really fs around with this and decides to still have State citizens but not USA citizens?

What he did is simply say that the 14th has been incorrectly interpreted by the courts and everybody else. He says that it only applies to children born in the US to US parents. Nothing more, nothing less.

>But the Fourteenth Amendment has never been interpreted to extend citizenship universally to everyone born within the United States.  The Fourteenth Amendment has always excluded from birthright citizenship persons who were born in the United States but not “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.”  Consistent with this understanding, the Congress has further specified through legislation that “a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof” is a national and citizen of the United States at birth, 8 U.S.C. 1401, generally mirroring the Fourteenth Amendment’s text.  

And what's even more wild is that if I'm reading things right the definition he's picked (8 U.S.C. 1401) has 8 meanings of what it takes and the very first one is to be born in the US and be subject to the jurisdiction, nothing about parentage I assume because, well, the constitution says don't care about that. And that's made doubly clear by the other 7 definitions which include lineage for when you're outside of the US(If you include parents in some definitions and not in others it must be a variable that matters in context). So I think all he did was give good a good case for non-constitutional law saying that birthright citizenship is legal.

I'm kind of wondering who helped him with his homework because I think they might be working against him.

>Conflicting nationality laws are one of the main causes of ""stateless births"".[5] At birth, nationality is usually acquired through one of two modes, although many nations recognize both modes today:

> - Jus soli (""right of soil"") denotes a regime by which nationality is acquired through birth on the territory of the state. This is common in the Americas.[6]

> - Jus sanguinis (""right of blood"") is a regime by which nationality is acquired through descent, usually from a parent who is a national.[7] Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania grant nationality at birth based upon the principle of jus sanguinis.

>A person who has neither parent eligible to transmit nationality by jus sanguinis is ""born stateless"" if born in a state which does not recognize jus soli. For instance, a child born outside Canada to two Canadian parents who were also born outside Canada would not be a Canadian national, since jus sanguinis is recognized only for the first generation in Canada. If that child were born in India and neither parent had naturalized yet, then the child would be stateless, since India confers nationality only to children born to at least one Indian parent.[8]

It doesn't say anything about invaders, but I suppose that if another country invaded the US, and the invaders were able to keep US officials out of their conquered territory and thus unable to enforce the US's laws there, children of those invaders born in that territory would not be under the jurisdiction of the US and would not be granted citizenship.

Undocumented immigrants are very much subject to the jurisdiction of the US; they can get arrested and convicted of crimes just like any citizen, and unlike diplomats with immunity.",1737494036.0,2025-01-21 22:13:56,news

So, yeah, Trump canning the pandemic response team, refusing to keep the national stockpile of medical supplies (including masks and gloves) up to date, and refusing to follow the pandemic response plan that’d been constantly improved upon since the mid 1990s, refusing to acknowledge the deadly disease spreading across Asia was already inside our borders, insisting it’ll go away on its own, and refusing something as basic as being a role model for others to follow with regard to washing hands and wearing a mask (which is weird since he’s notoriously germaphobic)…none of that was good.
